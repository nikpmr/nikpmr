## Nick Palmer
### Full Stack Developer & Entrepreneur

As a full-stack developer with years of business and marketing experience, I give your team what's needed to take on any web project, whether it be a full-stack app or a website below your minimum budget. Set your focus back to marketing and I can care of the rest.

I utilize a delicate balance of skill and strategy to ensure you get the best possible return on investment for each project. No matter what it is you need, the first step is to formulate a plan to deliver resourcefully, efficiently, and in a way that monumentally benefits your business.

What others say:

> "Nick has seldom said (if ever) I am unable to develop that. Whatever the request, or how far-fetched, Nick has been able to devise a digital solution that supports our original objective."
> -Tyler Tagami, Account Executive

> "Working with Nick is a breeze. Heâ€™s very calm and collected which is helpful for an individual like me who's often juggling more things at once than one person should. I can get Nick an overview of what the end product needs to look like and thoughts on the interface and next thing I know the product is ready to review. If I run into unforeseen issues or need updates to a site, Nick is quick to get them in. "
